To add music to your game:

1. Place your music files (.mp3 or .ogg format) in the `music` folder
2. Name them something simple, like:
   - track1.mp3
   - track2.mp3
   - menu_music.mp3

3. The game will automatically look for and play these files when levels load.

Note: The music folder is now created. Add your audio files there!
